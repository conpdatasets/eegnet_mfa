## Task Description

Participants completed four cognitive tasks dynamically adjusted for individual differences in speed and accuracy to maintain consistent difficulty levels. The tasks included a response-cueing task, go/no-go task, Eriksen flanker task, and time-estimation task. Each task targeted specific performance-monitoring processes, such as response inhibition, error processing, and feedback evaluation, with stimulus-response parameters counterbalanced across participants. Task completion took approximately 45â€“60 minutes, and response windows and interstimulus intervals were adjusted based on individual accuracy to ensure balanced outcomes.

## Participant Demographics Disclaimer

Age related demographic information in this dataset is uncoded, except in the cases of subjects "0004" and "0007". These subjects perferred not to disclose their age, and thus have had their ages set to the mean age of the cohort.
